This PhD research started at University of São Paulo (USP) in late 2020.
Besides the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the author was working in
a full-time job as \emph{principal machine learning engineer} at
\href{https://www.elo7.com.br}{Elo7} -- an experience that inspired
this research. In 2023, this PhD started being developed in a sandwich
doctorate in the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) in the Netherlands.
Since 2024, the author has been employed as a \emph{scientific programmer}
in the \href{https://marit-d.eu/}{MARIT-D European project}.

This chapter presents a work plan to execute the research methodology
from \cref{chap:research_methodology}. The timeline considers this PhD
is not a full-time activity. \Cref{tab:work_plan} accounts time to:
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\begin{itemize}
