% % [ ] What is the big data phenomenon?
% Data is being produced on a scale never seen in history. The so-called
% ``big data phenomenon'' has been represented by three changes in how
% data is collected and processed:
%   the volume, going from terabytes up to zettabytes of storage;
%   the variety, going from structured to more unstructured sources; and
%   the velocity, going from batch to streaming%
% ~\parencite{Sagiroglu2013BigReview}.
% Meanwhile, reasoning over and making decisions from large amounts of data
% has become a challenge and an opportunity for both academia and industry
% worldwide~\parencite{Lu2020ArtificialInnovation}.

% % [ ] What is Data Science?
% Data Science (DS) is an interdisciplinary field that mixes different skill
% sets to collect, organize, and analyze data \parencite{Hayashi1998WhatExample}.
% Traditionally, these tasks were in the realm of Statistics, which provides
% techniques to create insights from data. However, handling big data also
% requires knowledge about other fields, such as Computer Science, Business,
% and Sociology~\parencite{Cao2018DataScience,Dhar2013DataPrediction}.
% This enables creating data products that solve problems such as
% classification, recommendation, or decision-making%
% ~\parencite{Cao2018DataScience,Lakshmanan2020MachinePatterns}.

% % [ ] What are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?
% There is no generally accepted definition for Artificial Intelligence (AI)%
% ~\parencite{Emmert-Streib2020ArtificialStatus}. As a field, the goal of AI
% is to understand and build intelligent entities, encompassing methods
% from different areas~\parencite{RussellS2021Artificial4th}. Among them,
% Machine Learning (ML) comprehends techniques that can learn from data,
% producing empirical solutions for problems~\parencite{Abu-Mostafa2012LearningData}.
% These broad descriptions blurry the line between the domains of Statistics,
% AI, and ML~\parencite{Emmert-Streib2020ArtificialStatus}. Regardless,
% the task of modeling, i.e., creating models from data, has become
% one of the primary responsibilities of modern data scientists%
% ~\mbox{\parencite{Burkov2020MachineEngineering,Kim2016TheTeams,
% Lakshmanan2020MachinePatterns}}.

% % What are the limitations of Data Science?
% Since 2011, the interest in the term Data Science has grown steadily,
% with ``data scientist'' considered ``the sexiest job of the 21st century''%
% ~\parencite{Cao2018DataScience,Davenport2012DataCentury}. Big tech companies
% such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple started developing and launching more
% AI-based products. Their experience led to an important understanding:
% models make only a small part of real-world intelligent systems%
% ~\mbox{\parencite{Hulten2018BuildingSystems,Sculley2015HiddenSystems}}.
% Furthermore, AI/ML applications have three different axes of change:
% code, model, and data~\parencite{Sato2019ContinuousLearning}.
% This makes them inherently more complex than traditional software-based
% information systems~\parencite{Amershi2019SoftwareStudy}. In fact, building
% intelligent systems requires considering a whole AI hierarchy of needs%
% ~\parencite{Rogati2017TheNeeds}, whereas maintaining them demands rigor
% against many types of technical debt~\parencite{Sculley2015HiddenSystems}.
% Unfortunately, Data Science alone does not focus on these requirements%
% ~\parencite{Burkov2020MachineEngineering,Makinen2021WhoHelp,Menzies2020TheAI,
% Sato2019ContinuousLearning}.

% % [ ] What is Machine Learning Engineering?
% \emph{Machine Learning Engineering} (MLE) is a discipline that combines scientific
% principles, tools, and techniques from both Machine Learning and Software Engineering
% to build ML-enabled systems, including all stages from data collection to modeling
% and delivery~\parencite{Burkov2020MachineEngineering}. MLE complements
% Data Science by addressing the remaining infrastructure required by ML-enabled
% systems, encompassing their three axes of change~\parencite{Ozkaya2020WhatSystems,
% Sato2019ContinuousLearning}. Likewise, \emph{machine learning engineers}
% are a new set of specialized software engineers that help data scientists
% to build, deliver, and operate intelligent systems%

% [ ] What is Machine Learning Engineering?
Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) combines scientific principles, tools,
and techniques from both Machine Learning and Software Engineering to build
intelligent systems, including all stages from data collection to modeling
and delivery~\parencite{Burkov2020MachineEngineering}. MLE complements
Data Science by addressing the remaining infrastructure required by AI/ML
systems, encompassing their axes of change~\parencite{Ozkaya2020WhatSystems,
Sato2019ContinuousLearning}. Likewise, \emph{machine learning engineers}
are a new set of specialized software engineers that help data scientists
to build, deliver, and operate intelligent systems%
~\mbox{\parencite{Burkov2020MachineEngineering,Lakshmanan2020MachinePatterns}}.

% [ ] What is Intelligent Software Engineering? What is MLOps?
The study and adaptation of Software Engineering practices for AI/ML
systems have received different names in both academia and industry:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intelligent Software Engineering -- ISE
        \parencite{Xie2018IntelligentEngineering},
  \item Software Engineering for Machine Learning -- SE4ML
        \parencite{Amershi2019SoftwareStudy,
                   Martinez-Fernandez2022SoftwareSurvey,
                   Sculley2015HiddenSystems}, and
  \item Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence -- SE4AI 
        \parencite{Carleton2020TheSE,
                   Kastner2020TeachingSystems,
                   Martinez-Fernandez2022SoftwareSurvey,
                   Menzies2020TheAI}.
\end{itemize}
Although there is no consensus, the last term seems to be the most popular.
Nevertheless, this project will use them interchangeably.

% [ ] What is MLOps?
Among SE4AI practices, Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML)
has received particular attention~\parencite{Sato2019ContinuousLearning}.
It extends the concept of Continuous Delivery (CD) to address the
complexities of AI/ML systems. Meanwhile, Machine Learning Operations,
also known as MLOps, became a trend in academia and industry%
~\parencite{Tamburri2020SustainableChallenges}. Inspired by the
DevOps movement, it describes a new generation of infrastructure tools
that help to manage different stages of the lifecycle of an intelligent system%
~\mbox{\parencite{Gift2021PracticalModels,Stenac2020IntroducingMLOps}}.
In summary, MLOps enables CD4ML similarly to how DevOps enables CD.
